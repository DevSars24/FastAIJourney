FastAIJourney

🚀 Welcome to FastAIJourney – my quest to master FastAPI and Machine Learning to build AI-powered web applications! As a MERN stack developer, I'm diving into Python to create high-performance APIs and integrate cutting-edge AI models like Hugging Face. My goal? To stand out in the AI era, contribute to the tech community, and land a killer internship in 2025! 💻


About Me
I'm DevSars24, a passionate web developer with experience in MERN stack (check out my mern-notes-backend and BlogSphere-Hub) and basic DevOps knowledge. Now, I'm leveling up with FastAPI and ML to build scalable, AI-driven web apps. Inspired by resources like CampusX and FastAPI's official docs, this repo documents my learning journey and projects.


Why This Journey?
In the AI-driven tech world of 2025, combining web development with machine learning is the key to staying ahead. FastAPI's async power and Python's ML ecosystem (Hugging Face, Scikit-learn) make it the perfect tool to build next-gen APIs. This repo tracks my progress from Python basics to deploying AI-powered APIs, with a focus on practical projects that solve real-world problems.


Goals

Learn Python fundamentals and async programming.
Master FastAPI for building high-performance REST APIs.
Integrate ML models (e.g., text summarization, sentiment analysis) into web apps.
Build 2-3 portfolio projects to showcase for internships.
Apply DevOps practices (CI/CD with GitHub Actions) to deploy projects.

Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI, Python
Machine Learning: Hugging Face (Transformers), Scikit-learn
Frontend: React (for UI in full-stack projects)
Database: MongoDB (via pymongo), SQLite
DevOps: GitHub Actions, Render/Heroku for deployment
Tools: Postman (API testing), Swagger UI (API docs)

Projects
1. Text Summarizer API
A FastAPI-based API that summarizes text using Hugging Face's BART model. Integrated with MongoDB to store summaries and a React frontend for user interaction.

Status: In progress (Week 4-8)
Features: POST endpoint for text input, ML-powered summarization, MongoDB storage
Folder: fastapi_projects/text_summarizer
Demo (coming soon): [Link to deployed app]

2. Chatbot API (Planned)
A conversational AI API using FastAPI and Hugging Face's DialoGPT model for customer support use cases.

Status: Planned for Week 9-12
Folder: fastapi_projects/chatbot_api

Challenges & Learnings

Week 1: Struggled with Python's async/await syntax. Solved by comparing with JavaScript's async/await and watching Corey Schafer's YouTube tutorials.
Week 4: Setting up FastAPI with Pydantic models was tricky. Fixed by following FastAPI's official docs.
Check docs/challenges.md for detailed logs.
